# Eaves 🪶

**Eaves** is a "headless" high-fidelity audio recorder designed for speed, minimalism, and stealth.

## Features
* **Zero Interface:** No screens, no menus, no loading times.
* **One Tap:** Tap the icon to start recording instantly in the background. Tap again to save.
* **Studio Quality:** Captures crystal-clear AAC audio at 192kbps directly to your local storage.
* **Invisible:** Runs silently with only a system-required notification.

## How it Works
1.  **Tap to Start:** The app launches, starts a foreground service, and immediately closes the UI.
2.  **Recording:** A subtle notification indicates the microphone is active.
3.  **Tap to Stop:** Tapping the icon again stops the service and saves the file.
4.  **Storage:** Files are saved safely to `/Internal Storage/Music/Eaves/`.

## Why isn't this on the Play Store?
Eaves is a custom-built utility, not a commercial product. The Google Play Store requires all apps to have visible user interfaces. Because Eaves is designed to be a "Power Tool"—bypassing screens for instant capture—it deliberately breaks those UI rules.

## Installation
Go to the [Releases](github.com/RyuunAkasa/Project-Eaves-Android-/releases/tag/0.2) page to download the latest APK.
